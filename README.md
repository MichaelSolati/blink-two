# \<blink-two\>

A second attempt at the HTML Blink Element (`<blink>`). A non-standard element which causes the enclosed text to flash slowly.

## Installation

You can either install `<blink-two>` via NPM or include it via a CDN.

NPM:

```bash
npm install blink-two
```

CDN:

```HTML
<script src="https://unpkg.com/blink-two@1.0.0/dist/index.js"></script>
```

If you do use this library from NPM be sure to import it somewhere in your JS code:

```JavaScript
import 'blink-two';
```

## Usage

You can easily use `<blink-two>` by just wrapping any content inside of the tag:

```HTML
<blink-two>Blink Two Demo</blink-two>
```

Doing that will get you this:
